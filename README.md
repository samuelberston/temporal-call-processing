# Temporal Call Processing

This Temporal workflow processes calls from an AI Voice assistant and performs the following tasks:
- classification of the call as: booked, unbooked, excused, emergency
- flagging of the call as: hallucinated, incomplete, quality_issue
- tagging of the call as: callback_required, is_spam, estimate_required
